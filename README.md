**In this project we use Spark with Python to find the average number of friends for each age group person.**

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark**

**What is Apache Spark?**

Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.

**This dataset which we downloaded contains 3 columns:** <br></br>
 **(Name):** The name of person<br></br>
 **(Age):** The age of person
 **(Num-Friends):** Number of Friends of that person

**Important Note: Go through the dataset before jumping to the code.**
